# TF-IDF

**TF-IDF** stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It's a numerical statistic used to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

**How it Works:**

- *Term Frequency (TF):* This measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. A higher TF indicates that the word is more important within that document. Â  
- *Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):* This measures how rare a term is across the entire document collection. A higher IDF indicates that the word is less common, making it more valuable.
