# Interpolation

Interpolation is a technique used in data preprocessing to estimate unknown values within a dataset based on known data points. It's particularly useful for handling missing values or creating new data points between existing ones.

### How it works:
- Identify missing values: Pinpoint the data points where information is absent.
- Choose an interpolation method: Select the appropriate technique based on the data's characteristics.
- Estimate missing values: Calculate the missing values using the chosen method.
 
### Common Interpolation Methods:
- Linear interpolation: Assumes a linear relationship between data points.   
- Polynomial interpolation: Fits a polynomial curve to the data.   
- Spline interpolation: Uses piecewise polynomials for smoother curves.
