## Dynamic Time Wraping

A technique for comparing two, typically temporal, sequences that are not quite synchronized is called **dynamic time warping**, or DTW. It is a technique to determine how well two sequences match. DTW is helpful in a variety of fields, including financial markets, data mining, and speech recognition. The measurement of the separation between two-timeÂ series is frequently employed in data mining.
