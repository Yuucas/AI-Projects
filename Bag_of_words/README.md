## How it works:
Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words (tokens).
Vocabulary Creation: A unique list of all words in the text corpus is created. This is called the vocabulary.
Vectorization: Each document is represented as a numerical vector, where each element corresponds to a word in the vocabulary. The value of the element represents the frequency of that word in the document.
